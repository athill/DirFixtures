#ScaffoldDirs

The point of this module is to easily create, delete, and copy directory structures. It came about because of the larger goal of my unified-migration-theory project, which got stonewalled when I discovered the difficulty of maintaining test directories for umt.

One epiphany later, I decided to get back to brass tacks and write a python module that could easily create and destroy directory structures for testing purposes. This is v0.8 of that module.
